    <h1>ðŸŒ± Seed & Grow</h1>
    <p class="intro">
      In the beginning, there was a seed.<br/>
      In some stories, the whole world was folded into a mustard seedâ€”dense, unknowable, vibrating with potential.<br/><br/>
      This tool begins the same way. Each seed you generate is a fragment of an archive paired with a prompt for world-building. Use it to imagine rituals, ecologies, languages, or futures.<br/><br/>
      Grow it however you wish: collage, text, cyanotype, sound, silence.<br/>
      Begin again. Begin small.
